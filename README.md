# Tea & Stats

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Selbosh/selbosh.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Selbosh/selbosh.github.io)

This web site is written using the `blogdown` package by Yihui Xie and rendered using the [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) static web site generator.

It is deployed to GitHub Pages using [Travis Continuous Integration](https://travis-ci.org/).
This means the (R) Markdown files are rendered into HTML by a cloud server, rather than having to generate them locally and then push them online.
Thus, I can write and edit blog posts from anywhere without any special software installed.

The blog theme is called [Hugo Tea](https://github.com/Selbosh/hugo-tea) and you can download it for yourself if you like.
