Next week I will be presenting a poster at the [useR!2017](https://user2017.brussels) conference in Brussels.

My topic is **Ranking influential communities in networks**.
Using a large dataset of citations from the Web of Science, we grouped academic journals into communities based on their citation behaviour.
These communities closely correspond to recognisable research fields, so I was able to label them.

We then modelled the flow of influence within and between these communities.
A journal having a high influence score means it tends to receive more citations than it gives out when interacting with other influential journals.

Statistics comes second in the inter-field ranking (after economics).
We all know how cool statistics is, so the model must be right.

Here is a preview.
You can download the full PDF on the [conference web site](https://user2017.brussels/posters).

The poster is mostly reproducible: the full R source code for the analysis is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Selbosh/user2017), as is the Scribus file that generated the poster itself.
I say 'mostly' because the code is open but unfortunately the raw data is not.

In a maximally reproducible workflow, we could even consider designing the entire poster with Markdown.
An idea for a future R package, perhaps?
