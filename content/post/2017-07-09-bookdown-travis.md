title: Knitting a bookdown book in the Cloud with Travis CI
draft: true

There is a guide to this in the official `bookdown` book, but this predates Travis's introduction of native support for [GitHub Pages Deployment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/).

Thus it should be straightforward to come up with a guide for both GitHub Pages use cases:

1. GitHub project pages (deploying to `gh-pages` branch or `/docs/` folder)
2. GitHub user pages (deploying to `master` branch of `username.github.io`)

Coming soon!
