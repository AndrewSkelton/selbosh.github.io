Last summer I took part in an internship with the fledgling Alan Turing Institute at the British Library in London.
My group helped analyse data from [Cloudy with a Chance of Pain](https://www.cloudywithachanceofpain.com/), a citizen science project that uses smartphone app data to model the relationship between weather and joint pain.

A robust statistical model relies on a steady stream of self-reported pain data from each participant.
Naturally, the actual data available was nothing like that.
It looked more like this:

Unlike in a traditional epidemiological study, people could join at any time.
Some reported data every day, some every couple of days, some had one week on, one week off, while others would lose interest after a few months, after a few weeks or even after the first day.

To avoid selection bias in a later analysis, we need to understand the behaviour of these participants.

An article about my project was recently published in [*Significance*](https://www.significancemagazine.com/), the magazine of the Royal Statistical Society and American Statistical Association.
